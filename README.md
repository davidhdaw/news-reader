# The New New York Times
#### A Turing Mod 4 Take Home Project from [David Daw](https://github.com/davidhdaw) built in 6 hours using React!

The New New York Times is a lightweight way to get top stories from the New York Times news feed.

### How to access the application:
#### Go to this [link](https://news-reader-six.vercel.app/) where the application is deployed on Vercel

#### Or if you prefer to access the code as well as the application follow these *installation instructions*

- Clone down this repository into your local machine
- `cd` into the root directory of the repo
- Run `npm i` in your console to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` in the console to start the sever and access the application from your browser

#### Usage 

Once you've opened the New New York Times you'll be taken to the minimalist feed of the New York Times current top stories. You'll also be able to filter stories by specific sections of the times or even create custom searches.

#### Testing Instructions
In your terminal, run `npx cypress open` to see that user flows have been tested and the app is passing all tests!

##### David Daw Reflection:
While I obviously still have plenty of learning to do with React this project really let me explore what I could do with the Library in a short amount of time. Since I was given an intentionally light MVP I was able to quickly reach my initial goals and use the rest of my time exploring stretch techs like local storage. This project was a mod 4 take home assignment at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/).

##### Planned Future Features
Additional styling including special layouts for featured stories.
